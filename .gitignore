# If you have large datasets that should NOT be versioned, add patterns here.
# Example (uncomment to ignore all .npy in data/):
# data/*.npy
# data/*.npz

# Keep `data/` tracked by default since small example images (ex: data/flor.png)
# are part of the exercises; ignore only large files intentionally.
